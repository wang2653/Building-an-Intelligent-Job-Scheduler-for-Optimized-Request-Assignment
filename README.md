## Overview

The Intelligent Job Scheduler integrates a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model with a sleek, user-friendly web interface and an AI-powered chatbot to minimize patient waiting times and streamline ED operations. Designed to dynamically balance resource availability with patient needs, this system has demonstrated a significant reduction in weighted delays compared to traditional rule-based schedulers.

## Features

- **Smart Scheduling:**  
  Utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to make real-time, data-driven decisions that optimize patient assignment based on acuity, arrival times, and resource constraints.

- **Intuitive Web Interface:**  
  A clean, responsive design built with HTML and CSS that allows doctors and patients to interact effortlessly. Features include:
  - A main website with interactive navigation.
  - A unified login page for both patients and doctors.
  - A dedicated doctor dashboard with real-time data updates.

- **AI-Powered Chatbot (MediGuide):**  
  Offers immediate, evidence-based responses to health inquiries, ensuring patients receive clear guidance and, when necessary, advice to consult healthcare professionals.

- **Real-Time Performance:**  
  Ensures page load times under 1 second and button response times below 0.1 seconds, providing a smooth user experience even during peak loads.

- **Robust Testing & Validation:**  
  Extensive evaluation confirms that the DRL-based scheduler outperforms conventional methods with up to 40% improvement in reducing waiting times and minimizing penalty patients.
