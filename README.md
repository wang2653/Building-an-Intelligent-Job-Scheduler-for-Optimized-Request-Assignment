## 🏥 Overview

The Intelligent Job Scheduler integrates a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model with a sleek, user-friendly web interface and an AI-powered chatbot to minimize patient waiting times and streamline ED operations. Designed to dynamically balance resource availability with patient needs, this system has demonstrated a significant reduction in weighted delays compared to traditional rule-based schedulers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Scheduling:**  
  Utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to make real-time, data-driven decisions that optimize patient assignment based on acuity, arrival times, and resource constraints.

- **Intuitive Web Interface:**  
  A clean, responsive design built with HTML and CSS that allows doctors and patients to interact effortlessly. Features include:
  - A main website with interactive navigation.
  - A unified login page for both patients and doctors.
  - A dedicated doctor dashboard with real-time data updates.

- **AI-Powered Chatbot (MediGuide):**  
  Offers immediate, evidence-based responses to health inquiries, ensuring patients receive clear guidance and, when necessary, advice to consult healthcare professionals.

## 🤖 Future Enhancements
Future works will include the integration of multi-modal streams of data and testing advanced algorithmic strategies to enhance system flexibility and robustness. One such way is the use of electronic health records (EHRs), and continuous patient feedback to measure the full spectrum of drivers of patient flow.
